# DLinear

DLinear conducts direct multi-step forecasting by decomposing the time series into a trend and a remainder series and employs two one-layer linear networks to model these two series for the forecasting task. Then, two one-layer linear networks are applied to the two series.

Although DLinear is simple, it has some compelling characteristics:

- *An $O(1)$ maximum signal traversing path length*: The shorter the path, the better the dependencies are captured [18], making DLinear capable of capturing both short-range and long-range temporal relations.
- *High-efficiency*: As each branch has only one linear layer, it costs much lower memory and fewer parameters and has a faster inference speed than existing Transformers.
- *Interpretability*: After training, we can visualize weights from the seasonality and trend branches to have some insights on the predicted values [8].
- *Easy-to-use*: DLinear can be obtained easily without tuning model hyper-parameters.
